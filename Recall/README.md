# Object-Oriented-Programming
## This repository will recall the lessons discussed from the 2nd term, Intermediate Programming.
Other things to consider:
#
Inheritance is adapting the same listings of one class to two or more classes. This is so that you don't have to repeat the same listing of codes (Parent, Child).
#
Polymorphism is an object whose identity can be more than one type (car (vehicle), bike (vehicle), boat (vehicle). Therefore, all 3 are vehicle).
#
Inheritance - a parent and child/s, association - basic correlation of two classes, aggregasion - one can be in a group and can be solo, composition - independency to one class
